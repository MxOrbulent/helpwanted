### Why not simply ask the original creator for source?
I wanted to remap this myself for the experience. And it succeeded, it works perfectly.
I'd also suggest to others that if you release something as "CopyLeft" or Public Domain, that you also
release the source. If you use git, it takes basically no time at all to do it.
If you want to be a greedy handrubber and keep the code to yourself, don't use things like a MIT license.

### Don't you need to ask for permission?
The original creator set his release as MIT, this means that doing basically anything with the compiled binaries are
100% fair game. So no, I don't need his permission at all. The only thing I need to provide is a MIT license.

I also want to note that he missed filling in the proper copyrights, this effectively places
the project entirely in the public domain and makes him loose control of the project 100%. This includes trademarks 
because a mit license must be properly filled out or it's invalid. 
Copyrights are granted by default, that's true. 
But kinda hard to truly say he has the copyright now does it? 
This is why you check your licenses that are generated.


I fixing copyright notice as a token of good faith by publishing
a proper mit license which correctly fills out the copyright part of the mit license and points back to the
original creator. Removing any possible doubt as of the publishment of the license.

### Why not also decompile and remap for Forge?
I have no interest in Forge. You have the source now, do it yourself. I spent some 8 hours studying
and remapping. If you can't be arsed to atleast try, you should not be running a minecraft server.

### Will you maintain this?
No guarantees. If my own server project succeeds then yes I will maintain it.
If the mod author releases his source code proper, then I will not maintain this repo for public use.
